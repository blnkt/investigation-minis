  "content": "<p>Because all Type Ia supernovae have the same intrinsic brightness, we can calculate their distances from their apparent magnitudes. Astronomers use a relationship called the distance modulus to calculate the distance to a supernova. The distance modulus (DM) is the difference between the peak apparent magnitude (m) and the peak absolute magnitude (M). For Type Ia supernovae, M is always the same value: -19.4. So the DM = (m - (- 19.4)) or (m + 19.4).</p><p>In order to calculate the actual distance from Earth, the value for the distance modulus (DM) is inserted into the equation below:</p><p>d = 10 ^ ((DM+5)/5)</p><p>Where distance (d) is expressed in parsecs*, and DM is your value for the distance modulus.</p><p>*1 parsec = 3.26 light years</p><p>The following questions will guide you through the distance calculations for the supernovae from the previous section.  The apparent magnitudes you observed in the previous section are in the table.  After you calculate the distances to the supernovae, the distances will be added to the table in MLy.</p>",
